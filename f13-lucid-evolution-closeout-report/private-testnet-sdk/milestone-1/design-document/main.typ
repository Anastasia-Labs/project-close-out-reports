= Problem Analysis and Solution Rationale

\
This section details the challenges in current Cardano development workflows and explains the strategic reasoning behind the Lucid Evolution 2.0 SDK.

\
== Identified Problems
\
Current Cardano development workflows face several significant obstacles:

- *External Tool Dependencies:* Developers often rely on bash scripts or raw Docker commands that are separate from their main testing code. This leads to unstable setups and inconsistent test results.

- *Inaccurate Environments:* Many existing testing tools use incomplete emulators that do not accurately simulate real Cardano blockchain behavior. This causes unreliable tests that fail to mirror mainnet conditions.
- *Complex Setup:* Manual configuration of private testnets requires extensive infrastructure knowledge and consumes significant developer time, delaying project initiation.
- *Poor Integration:* The lack of direct TypeScript integration with testing tools creates workflow inefficiencies, requiring developers to manage disparate systems.


\
== Design Objectives
\
Our solution architecture is designed to overcome these problems by achieving the following core objectives:

- *Direct Control:* Provide intuitive TypeScript APIs for complete testnet lifecycle management.

- *Real Node Integration:* Utilize actual Cardano nodes instead of emulators to ensure authentic blockchain behavior and accurate testing.
- *Enhanced Developer Experience:* Offer simple default configurations for quick starts, alongside comprehensive customization options for advanced use cases.
- *Production Parity:* Ensure that private testnets behave identically to the Cardano mainnet, enabling highly reliable and confident contract testing.
\

== Key Advantages
\
This SDK offers substantial advantages throughout the development lifecycle:

- *Significant Reduction* in developer setup time for testing environments.

- *Elimination of external script dependencies*, simplifying workflows and reducing maintenance.
- *Enhanced Reliability* through real Cardano node integration, leading to more accurate test results.
- *Improved Test Coverage* via consistent, reproducible environments, fostering higher quality dApps.

= Architecture Overview

\
This section presents a high-level overview of the SDK's architecture, illustrating how its core components interact to provide private testnet functionality.

\
#figure(
  image("../../../images/private-testnet-sdk.png", height: 80%),
  caption: [
    Private Testnet SDK
  ],
)


#pagebreak()

The diagram above illustrates the layered architecture of the Lucid Evolution 2.0 SDK. Here's a breakdown of each key component:

\
- *DevNet Management Layer:* This part of the SDK handles the full lifecycle of your testnets. It manages container orchestration (starting, stopping, and removing them), generates necessary configurations (like genesis files and cryptographic keys), and ensures proper resource and port isolation for each testnet.
\
- *Provider Integration Layer:* This layer connects your application to the testnet. It implements Kupo and Ogmios as a Provider interface, letting you submit transactions, query UTxOs, retrieve datums, and interact with the blockchain. It also extends this functionality to manage off-chain transactions, and on-chain settlement processes.
\
- *Container Runtime Libraries (Dockerode / Testcontainers):* These are Node.js libraries that provide the programming interface to interact directly with Docker. They allow the SDK to programmatically control Docker containers.
\
- *Underlying Infrastructure (Docker Runtime):* This is the foundation. It's the Docker engine running real Cardano nodes (supporting any era), Kupo indexer, and Ogmios server, each isolated within its own container. This ensures your tests run against environments that truly mimic the production network.

#pagebreak()
== Technology Stack
\
The technology stack for Lucid Evolution 2.0 was selected to ensure robustness, type safety, and direct control over the testing environment.

\
===  Effect-TS 
\
- *Decision:* We adopted Effect-TS for functional programming and robust error handling.

- *Rationale:*

  + *Composability:* Complex container operations are composed functionally, resulting in modular and reusable code.

  + *Error Safety:* Tagged Errors provide precise failure context and structured recovery strategies, improving debugging and resilience.
  + *Type Safety:* Comprehensive static type checking eliminates common runtime errors, leading to more stable code.
  + *Concurrency* Offers superior handling of concurrent container operations, crucial for efficient testnet management.

\
*Implementation Example:*

```ts

export class CardanoDevNetError extends Data.TaggedError("CardanoDevNetError")<{
  reason: "container_not_found" | "container_creation_failed" | "container_start_failed" |
          "container_stop_failed" | "container_removal_failed" | "container_inspection_failed" |
          "temp_directory_creation_failed" | "config_file_write_failed" | "file_permissions_failed";
  message: string;
  cause?: unknown;
}> {}

```
\
`Disclaimer: This code example illustrates the intended functionality and is subject to change as development progresses.`

#pagebreak()
=== Dockerode Integration

- *Decision:* We support configuration for all Cardano eras (Byron, Shelley, Alonzo, Conway).

- *Rationale:*

  - *Historical Compatibility:* Allows testing of legacy transaction formats and behaviors.

  - *Era Transition Testing:* Enables validation of applications across hard fork boundaries.
  - *Complete Protocol Coverage:* Ensures support for all Cardano features and capabilities.
  - *Future Proofing:* The design is extensible for upcoming eras.

\
- *Structure Example:*

  ```ts

    interface DevNetConfig {
      readonly containerName?: string;
      readonly image?: string;
      readonly ports?: { readonly node: number; readonly submit: number };
      readonly networkMagic?: number;
      readonly nodeConfig?: Partial<NodeConfig>;
      readonly byronGenesis?: Partial<ByronGenesis>;
      readonly shelleyGenesis?: Partial<ShelleyGenesis>;
      readonly alonzoGenesis?: Partial<AlonzoGenesis>;
      readonly conwayGenesis?: Partial<ConwayGenesis>;
      readonly kesKey?: Partial<KesKey>;
      readonly opCert?: Partial<OpCert>;
      readonly vrfSkey?: Partial<VrfSkey>;
    }

  ```
\
  `Disclaimer: This code example illustrates the intended functionality and is subject to change as development progresses.`

#pagebreak()
#v(50pt)

= Core Component Design
\
This section details the primary internal components of the SDK, describing their functions and design benefits.

\
== Container Management Layer
\
This foundational layer handles all interactions with Docker, overseeing the entire lifecycle of Cardano node containers.
It's responsible for the direct programmatic control over your DevNet instances.

\
- *Core Functions:* This layer exposes the following key functions for managing DevNet containers, all returning an *`Effect`* for robust error handling:

  - *`make():`* Creates and provisions a new DevNet container, making it ready for use.

  - *`startContainer():`* Starts a previously created or stopped DevNet container.
  - *`stopContainer():`* Stops a running DevNet container without removing its data.
  - *`removeContainer():`* Removes a DevNet container and its associated data, cleaning up resources.
  - *`getContainerStatus():`* Retrieves the current status and detailed information about a specific DevNet container.

\
- *Primary Operations:*

  - *Lifecycle Operations:* Manages container creation, starting, stopping, and removal with comprehensive error handling.

  - *Configuration Generation:* Dynamically generates genesis files and node configurations within secure temporary directories.
  - *Port Management:* Automatically allocates and manages ports for node communication, including collision detection.
\
===  DevNet Initialization Example
\
To quickly spin up a private testnet and configure it with initial funds for testing, developers can use the following pattern:


```ts

const generateAccountForDevnet = () => {
  const privateKey = CML.PrivateKey.generate_ed25519();
  const publicKey = privateKey.to_public();
  const pubKeyHash = publicKey.hash();
  const keyhash = KeyHash.Decode.hex(pubKeyHash.to_hex());
  const addr = new EnterpriseAddress.EnterpriseAddress({
    networkId: NetworkId.NetworkId.make(0),
    paymentCredential: keyhash,
  });
  const hex = EnterpriseAddress.Encode.hex(addr);
  const address = EnterpriseAddress.Decode.hex(hex);
  const addressBech32 = Address.Encode.bech32(address);

  return {
    hex,
    keyhash,
    address,
    addressBech32,
    privateKey: privateKey.to_bech32(),
  } as const;
};

const account = generateAccountForDevnet();
console.log(`Generated address: ${JSON.stringify(account)})`);

const cluster = await Devnet.Cluster.makeOrThrow({
  clusterName: "devnet-1",
  shelleyGenesis: {
    epochLength: 1000,
    initialFunds: {
      [account.hex]: 123456789, // use full address hex instead of keyhash
    },
  },
});

await Devnet.Cluster.startOrThrow(cluster);

```
\
  `Disclaimer: This code illustrates the intended functionality and is subject to change as development progresses.`


#pagebreak()
- *Design Benefits:*

  - *Security:* Implements proper file permissions and secure key management practices.
  - *Flexibility:* Allows for customizable configuration with sensible defaults.
  - *Maintainability:* Promotes clear separation of concerns and a modular design.

\
== Provider Integration Layer
\
This component is designed to manage and expose the necessary services for accessing Cardano blockchain data and submitting transactions.

\
- *Kupo Integration:* The SDK will configure and manage a Kupo indexer instance alongside the DevNet. Kupo provides a robust and efficient way to query UTxOs and historical blockchain data. The SDK will expose endpoints to allow dApps to connect to this Kupo instance for data retrieval.

- *Ogmios Integration:* The SDK will manage an Ogmios server instance, providing a WebSocket interface to interact directly with the Cardano node. Ogmios will be used for real-time node communication, including transaction submission and chain synchronization.

- *Transparent Failover:* If a DevNet container stops unexpectedly, DevNetProvider will automatically attempt to restart it (configurable in *`DevNetConfig`*).


#pagebreak()
#v(50pt)
= Error Handling Strategy
\
A robust error handling system is critical for a reliable SDK. Error types in the SDK will come with documentation showing the errors and how to fix them with debug friendly error messages, ensuring stability and a positive developer experience.

#v(50pt)

= Key Interfaces & Types
\

This section details the essential TypeScript interfaces and types that developers will interact with when using the SDK, providing a clear contract for its functionality.

\
*Error Handling Definition*

  ```ts

export class CardanoDevNetError extends Data.TaggedError("CardanoDevNetError")<{
  reason: "container_not_found" | "container_creation_failed" | "container_start_failed" |
          "container_stop_failed" | "container_removal_failed" | "container_inspection_failed" |
          "temp_directory_creation_failed" | "config_file_write_failed" | "file_permissions_failed";
  message: string;
  cause?: unknown;
}> {}

  ```
\
*DevNet Container Interface*

\
```ts
  interface DevNetContainer { id: string; name: string; }
```

\
*DevNet Cluster Interface*

\
```ts
export interface DevNetCluster {
    readonly cardanoNode: DevNetContainer;
    readonly kupo?: DevNetContainer;
    readonly ogmios?: DevNetContainer;
    readonly networkName: string;
}
```

\
  `Disclaimer: These code blocks illustrates the intended functionality and is subject to change as development progresses.`

#pagebreak()

*Individual Container Lifecycle Functions*

\
These core functions manage the DevNet's state and return an *`Effect`* type for robust error handling.

```ts

// Starts a specific individual DevNet container.
start(container: DevNetContainer): Effect<void, CardanoDevNetError>
startOrThrow(container: DevNetContainer): Promise<void>

// Stops a specific individual DevNet container.
stop(container: DevNetContainer): Effect<void, CardanoDevNetError>
stopOrThrow(container: DevNetContainer): Promise<void>

// Removes a specific individual DevNet container.
remove(container: DevNetContainer): Effect<void, CardanoDevNetError>
removeOrThrow(container: DevNetContainer): Promise<void>

// Gets status information for a specific individual DevNet container.
getStatus(container: DevNetContainer): Effect<Docker.ContainerInspectInfo | undefined, CardanoDevNetError>
getStatusOrThrow(container: DevNetContainer): Promise<Docker.ContainerInspectInfo | undefined>

```

\
*DevNet Cluster Lifecycle Functions*

\
These functions operate on the entire *`DevNetCluster`* to manage its lifecycle.

```ts

  // Creates a new Cardano DevNet cluster, including optional Kupo and Ogmios containers.
make(config?: DevNetConfig): Effect<DevNetCluster, CardanoDevNetError>
makeOrThrow(config?: DevNetConfig): Promise<DevNetCluster> // Convenience method to throw on error

// Starts all containers within a DevNet cluster (Cardano node, then Kupo/Ogmios).
start(cluster: DevNetCluster): Effect<void, CardanoDevNetError>
startOrThrow(cluster: DevNetCluster): Promise<void> // Convenience method to throw on error

// Stops all containers within a DevNet cluster (Kupo/Ogmios first, then Cardano node).
stop(cluster: DevNetCluster): Effect<void, CardanoDevNetError>
stopOrThrow(cluster: DevNetCluster): Promise<void> // Convenience method to throw on error

// Removes all containers and associated network for a DevNet cluster.
remove(cluster: DevNetCluster): Effect<void, CardanoDevNetError>
removeOrThrow(cluster: DevNetCluster): Promise<void> // Convenience method to throw on error

```

#pagebreak()
*DevNet Configuration Interface*

\
This comprehensive interface allows for deep customization of the DevNet.

```ts

export interface DevNetConfig {
  readonly containerName?: string;
  readonly image?: string;
  readonly ports?: {
    readonly node: number;
    readonly submit: number;
  };
  readonly networkMagic?: number;
  readonly nodeConfig?: Partial<NodeConfig>;
  readonly byronGenesis?: Partial<ByronGenesis>;
  readonly shelleyGenesis?: Partial<ShelleyGenesis>;
  readonly alonzoGenesis?: Partial<AlonzoGenesis>;
  readonly conwayGenesis?: Partial<ConwayGenesis>;
  readonly kesKey?: Partial<KesKey>;
  readonly opCert?: Partial<OpCert>;
  readonly vrfSkey?: Partial<VrfSkey>;
}

```
\
  `Disclaimer: This code illustrates the intended functionality and is subject to change as development progresses.`

\
*Genesis Configuration Types*

Detailed types for each Cardano era's genesis file (*`NodeConfig`*, *`ByronGenesis`*, *`ShelleyGenesis`*, *`AlonzoGenesis`*, *`ConwayGenesis`*) and cryptographic key components (KesKey, OpCert, VrfSkey) enable granular control over network parameters.

\

*Default Configuration Constants*

Pre-defined default values for each configuration type (e.g., *`DEFAULT_NODE_CONFIG`*, *`DEFAULT_BYRON_GENESIS`*, *`DEFAULT_DEVNET_CONFIG`*) ensure zero-config usability.
