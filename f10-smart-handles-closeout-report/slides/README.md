## How to Start the Presentation

1. Install and run the local server:
```sh
pnpm install && pnpm start

# or

npm install && npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the presentation

The first page is left empty as there seems to be a bug with `reveal.js` (the
package used for generating the slides).

If you need to tweak/refine any texts in the slides, simply find them in
[`slides.md`](slides.md), and make changes as desired. The running serving will
automatically update and refresh the presentation.

Slides can be navigated with arrow keys. "Home" and "End" keys also work for
jumpting to first and last slides respectively.

Use "Esc" key to bring up the overview of a few slides before and after the
current one.

Slide numbers in the following section correspond to the number on the
bottom-left corner of the presentation.
