### Smart Handles
On-chain framework for using dapps without going through their official frontends

---

- Customizable with arbitrary logic

- Best suited for dedicated tasks, such as swapping ADA to MIN via Minswap

- Discoverable addresses by storing ADA Handles in instances

- All-round suite for easy product deployment

---

### How does it work?

---

1. User sends some ADA to `$ada-to-min` instance, reserving 1 ADA for the routing agent

2. Routing agent handles the route and collects its fee

3. Minswap batchers send original user proper amount of MIN tokens

---

### On-Chain Logic

---

- Router is reimbursed

- Funds go to the destination (specified as a parameter)

- Custom validation holds
